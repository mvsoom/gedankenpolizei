# SEER 1

## TODO

- Filter only between <narration> tags
- Use https://github.com/hzeller/timg (https://snapcraft.io/install/timg/raspbian)
- Check request constraints:
  > Number of request tokens has exceeded your per-minute rate limit (https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits); see the response headers for current usage. Please reduce the prompt length or the maximum tokens requested, or try again later. You may also contact sales at https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales to discuss your options for a rate limit increase.
  

## Latency issues

Knobs:

1. Smaller Claude model
2. Smaller image
3. Smaller memory bank size (# of previous images)

Quick latency (in sec) testing with a single sentence per tile, one frame per tile of size (640, 480):

- HAIKU:
  1.52, 1.55, 1.56, 1.61, 1.90, 2.00, 2.21, 2.70
- SONNET:
  2.36, 2.29, 2.58, 3.56, 3.26, 3.37, 3.49, 3.76
- OPUS:
  4.26, 3.93, 5.25, 5.17, 5.78, 7.53

The only other function that takes considerable time is the encode to PNG in order to send it to Claude, which is at most 0.1 sec.
