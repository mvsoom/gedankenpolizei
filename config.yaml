  bias:
    # The `intensity` parameter in [0, 1] controls the amount of bias in the walk in SLOW space
    # A value of 0. means no bias is applied to the step
    # A value of 1. means that the projections of the step onto the bias directions are enforced to be at least unity, even if they were negative originally
    intensity: 0.

    # Bias directions are relative vectors in SLOW space that are used to bias the direction of the walk in SLOW space
    # They are computed as `bias_direction = overall_multiplier*multiplier*(embed(to) - embed(from))`
    # Note: the `*multiplier` parameters can be negative
    # Note: embeddings are usually normalized to have unit norm, so the `*multipliers` can be used to dominate the step; a very large `overall_multiplier` will always align the step with the bias direction for any `intensity > 0`
