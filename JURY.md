Copy decryption key into .env variable

Copy Gemini credentials/keys into .env variable. I used Gemini Flash 1.5 with safety turned off and maxed out RPM at 1000.

I used Python 3.10.12 with a `.venv` determined by `requirements.txt`. Using Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS on a HP EliteBook 850 G5. Additional optional programs to install are:
```
ffmpeg
mdcat
cool-retro-term
lolcat
```
